# CPS-COVID-19-Dashboard

An Unofficial COVID-19 Data Visualization Dashboard created for College Prep made using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

Please don't use this code as exemplars! This is absolute spaghetti. :( Check out my other repos for cleaner code.

# Build from source

## Build Instructions

### Server
* Clone repo
* CD into repo dir, run `npm install` to install required dependencies
* If running on headless servers - modify line 15 in index.js to `const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true, defaultViewport: null });`
* To change the frequency of the script - Change `0 0 */1 * *` in line 1 of index.js to desired frequency. Syntax is CRON scheduler syntax.
